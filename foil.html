    <h2>What Is Foil?</h2>
    <p>
      Foil is one of the three modern Olympic fencing weapons. It is a light, flexible thrusting weapon designed to emphasize discipline, precision, and technique. Historically used as a training weapon for dueling, foil fencing emphasizes form and carefully structured attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the torso is a valid target, simulating the vital areas of the body. Because foil uses the right-of-way rule, fencers must follow strict tactical conventions to earn the priority needed to score.

  <section id="rules">
    <h2>Rules of Foil</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Right-of-Way:</strong> Priority rules determine who is awarded the touch if both fencers hit. Attacks, parries, and ripostes follow a clear order.</li>
      <li><strong>Target Area:</strong> Only the torso (front and back) counts as valid target, excluding arms, legs, and head.</li>
      <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> Points are scored with the tip of the foil on the valid target area.</li>
      <li><strong>Bout Format:</strong> Standard bouts last three 3-minute periods or end when one fencer reaches 15 touches.</li>
      <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Fencers wear a metallic lamé jacket to register valid touches electronically.</li>
      <li><strong>Penalties:</strong> Offenses include turning one’s back, covering target area, or failing to follow right-of-way conventions.</li>
    </ul>
