    <h2>What Is Fencing?</h2>
    <p>
      Fencing is a modern Olympic sport that evolved from historical sword combat. It is a fast, tactical, and highly athletic sport where two opponents face off using one of three weapons: foil, epee, or sabre. Each weapon has its own rules, target areas, and strategies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Competitive fencing emphasizes speed, accuracy, and the ability to outthink an opponent in real time. Despite its ancient origins, modern fencing is driven by electronic scoring systems and well‑defined international regulations.

    <h2>The History of Fencing</h2>
    <p>
      The roots of fencing stretch back thousands of years. Swordplay was practiced in ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Greece, and Rome. But fencing as we know it began to take shape during the Middle Ages, when sword combat became a formalized martial skill among knights and soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The development of the rapier in the 16th century marked a major shift. Duels became more focused on skill and precision rather than brute strength. Italian and Spanish masters created some of the earliest fencing manuals, laying the groundwork for modern technique.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the 18th and 19th centuries, fencing evolved further with the rise of the French school, which influenced modern footwork and form. By the late 1800s, fencing became codified as a sport and was one of the original events in the first modern Olympic Games in 1896.
